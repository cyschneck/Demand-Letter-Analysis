Black Students of I.U.
May 10, 1968

In an effort to be clear about the demands presented by Black students, the following conditions are herby stated.
We are concerned that many houses can, by law, operate in a racially discriminatory manner. We do not feel that any house that is currently in violation of University policy should be allowed to participate in the Little 500 race. If, indeed, all houses can show documentation that no national or local restrictions exist in their operations, we will conced to that legal point.
In order to moot our demands, we need the following documentation from the constitutions of all local fraternities:
1. A copy of their local constitution as it refers to the selection of numbers.
2. A plan of action that spells out, specifically, how desogragation will occur (i.e. recruiting plans, etc.)
Those house who do not produce this documentation will not be recognized as qualified to participate in the Little 500 race this year.
